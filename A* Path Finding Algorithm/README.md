# A-Pathfinding-Algorithm
I attempt an implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm to find the optimal path between two points in a 2D grid. I begin by explaining the mechanics of how the algorithm works, look at pseudo-code, and then write the algorithm in JavaScript using the p5.js library for rendering .
